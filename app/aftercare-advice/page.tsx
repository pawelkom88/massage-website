        I always complete a detailed consultation form before the first treatment begins, so I am
        aware of your medical history and can make sure that safe treatment can be used. If you are
        under a doctor&apos;s care, please consult your doctor first to see if massage is suitable
        for your condition. We will then discuss the desired outcome of your session. This will
        determine which parts of your body require massage.

        Your massage will take place in a warm, comfortable room. Soft music may be played to help
        you relax. You will lie on a heated table especially designed for your comfort. Most
        massages are traditionally performed with the client unclothed down to underwear; however,
        it is entirely up to you what you want to wear. You should undress to your level of comfort.
        I will leave the room while you undress, so you can relax onto the table, and cover yourself
        with a clean towel. You will be properly draped during the entire session to keep you warm
        and comfortable. Only the area being worked on will be exposed.

      <p className="mt-3 lg:text-lg">
        I will be using the finest massage oil, created by using pure essential oils blended with
        organic cold pressed sweet almond base oil. I could also use pure coconut oil or grape seed
        oil if you wish. If you have any allergies to these, you should let me know, and also state
        on the consultation form.
      </p>

        I have also UPDATED my massage bed for a state of art, top-of-the-range table with extra
        thick 6.5cms high density multi-layered foam, covered with Super soft SKIN-TOUCHTM luxurious
        PU upholstery. It has a super comfortable, extendable and adjustable head support with face
        cushion (12cms thick foam) and armrest. This professional grade table is designed to be
        wider in the client&apos;s shoulder and foot area to offer them maximum comfort.
