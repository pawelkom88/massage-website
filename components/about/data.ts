      "  I am an experienced, fully qualified and insured massage therapist. I am dedicated to providing you with the most suitable Massage Therapy, professionally tailored for your individual needs. From an early age I’ve been passionate about sport and when I was 16 years old I started to train in Taekwondo. After four years of almost every day training I won the title of Polish Champion. Taekwondo taught me to have respect for others and for myself, to fight for my dreams and follow my passions. All the knowledge and experience I gained during my intensive training helped me to become a better therapist.",

      "My adventure with massage started in 2009 and I can easily say that massage has changed my life. I am more aware of my body and its needs, I learnt that pain can be eased and most problems can be fixed so there is no reason to be stressed all the time. Massage makes me smile more, relieves muscle pain, stress and helps 'top up' my patience.",

      "All of my qualifications and years of experience have given me a lot of knowledge and the confidence to massage away all those aches, pains and every day stress we all have. What inspires me about my work is that no session is ever the same. We’re all structurally the same, but each body has a very different story to tell, it’s fascinating! I feel very blessed to have a career that I enjoy so much along with the opportunities to help people.",
